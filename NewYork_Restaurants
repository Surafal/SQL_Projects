We have put together a table of restaurants called nomnom and we need your help to answer some questions. Use the SQL commands you just learned and find the best dinner spots in the city.

The schema of this table is available here.

Let’s begin!

Write the following queries:
1.
Start by getting a feel for the nomnom table:

SELECT *
FROM nomnom;
What are the column names?

The column names are:

name
neighborhood
cuisine
review
price
health
2.
What are the distinct neighborhoods?

SELECT DISTINCT neighborhood
FROM nomnom;
The neighborhoods are:

Brooklyn
Midtown
Chinatown
Uptown
Queens
Downtown
3.
What are the distinct cuisine types?

SELECT DISTINCT cuisine
FROM nomnom;
The cuisine types are:

Steak
Korean
Chinese
Pizza
Ethiopian
Vegetarian
Italian
Japanese
American
Mediterranean
Indian
Soul Food
Mexican
4.
Suppose we would like some Chinese takeout.

What are our options?

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Chinese';
Yum!

5.
Return all the restaurants with reviews of 4 and above.

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE review >= 4;
6.
Suppose Abbi and Ilana want to have a fancy dinner date.

Return all the restaurants that are Italian and $$$.

If you want to find Italian restaurants with exactly three dollar signs:

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Italian'
   AND price = '$$$';
If you want to find Italian restaurants with at least three dollar signs:

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Italian'
   AND price LIKE '%$$$%';
7.
Your coworker Trey can’t remember the exact name of a restaurant he went to but he knows it contains the word ‘meatball’ in it.

Can you find it for him using a query?

% is a wildcard character that matches zero or more missing letters in the pattern.

To find the restaurant names that contain the word ‘meatball’:

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE name LIKE '%meatball%';
8.
Let’s order delivery to the house!

Find all the close by spots in Midtown, Downtown or Chinatown.

(OR can be used more than once)

We can use the OR operators to combine these conditions:

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE neighborhood = 'Midtown'
   OR neighborhood = 'Downtown'
   OR neighborhood = 'Chinatown'; 
Here, we have three conditions:

neighborhood = 'Midtown'
neighborhood = 'Downtown'
neighborhood = 'Chinatown'
OR Venn Diagram

9.
Find all the health grade pending restaurants (empty values).

Empty values are indicated by NULL.

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE health IS NULL;
10.
Create a Top 10 Restaurants Ranking based on reviews.

Using ORDER BY and the DESC keyword, we can sort the restaurants by ratings from highest to lowest:

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
ORDER BY review DESC;
Then, include a LIMIT to cap it at 10:

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
ORDER BY review DESC
LIMIT 10;
11.
Use a CASE statement to change the rating system to:

review > 4.5 is Extraordinary
review > 4 is Excellent
review > 3 is Good
review > 2 is Fair
Everything else is Poor
Don’t forget to rename the new column!

SELECT name,
 CASE
  WHEN review > 4.5 THEN 'Extraordinary'
  WHEN review > 4 THEN 'Excellent'
  WHEN review > 3 THEN 'Good'
  WHEN review > 2 THEN 'Fair'
  ELSE 'Poor'
 END AS 'Review'
FROM nomnom;
Here, the column is renamed to ‘Review’ using AS.
