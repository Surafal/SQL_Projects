1.------------------ Friends -----------SQL

Create a table named friends with three columns:

    id that stores INTEGER
    name that stores TEXT
    birthday that stores DATE

The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in the database:

CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column1 DATA_TYPE,
   column2 DATA_TYPE,
   column3 DATA_TYPE
);

Don’t forget the ; at the end!

Your code should look something like:

CREATE TABLE friends (
   id INTEGER,
   name TEXT,
   birthday DATE
);

2.

Beneath your current code, add Jane Doe to friends.

Her birthday is May 30th, 1990.

The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records into a table:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) 
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);

Your code should look something like:

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (1, 'Jane Doe', '1990-05-30');

For the `DATE` data type, the format is YYYY-MM-DD.
3.

Let’s make sure that Jane has been added to the database:

SELECT * 
FROM friends;

Check for two things:

    Is friends table created?
    Is Jane Doe added to it?

    SELECT * indicates that we want to select all columns.
    FROM friends indicates the table we are interested in.
    ; ends a SQL command.

The result should have three columns (id, name, birthday) and one row.
4.

Let’s move on!

Add two of your friends to the table.

Insert an id, name, and birthday for each of them.

Your code should look something like:

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (2, 'BFF One', 'YYYY-MM-DD');

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (3, 'BFF Two', 'YYYY-MM-DD');

5.

Jane Doe just got married! Her new last name is “Smith”.

Update her record in friends.

The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table:

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1
WHERE condition;

Your code should look something like:

UPDATE friends
SET name = 'Jane Smith'
WHERE id = 1;

6.

Add a new column named email.

The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table:

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN column DATA_TYPE;

Your code should look something like:

ALTER TABLE friends 
ADD COLUMN email TEXT; 

7.

Update the email address for everyone in your table.

Jane Smith’s email is jane@codecademy.com.

To update Jane’s email:

UPDATE friends
SET email = 'jane@codecademy.com'
WHERE id = 1;

And do the same for both of your friends.
8.

Wait, Jane Smith is not a real person.

Remove her from friends.

DELETE FROM friends
WHERE id = 1;

:(
9.

Great job! Let’s take a look at the result one last time:

SELECT * 
FROM friends;

The result should have four columns (id, name, birthday, email) and two rows.

If you are feeling ambitious, try adding a phone column, an instagram column, and more of your buddies to the table!
